## Dynasty Fantasy Football Tools

**Project description:** This project contains a variety of different tools that I am using to track the performance of the members of one of my Dynasty Fantasy Football Leagues. It originally started off as my Final Project for the Harvard CS50 course, but I have continued building upon it since then. 

For more Information about the construction of the app itself, you can refer to the <a href="https://www.github.com/MattDotsey/NellasFellas"> Github repository for the project</a>.

For the purposes of the portfolio, I will be focusing on later additions to the project in an attempt to analyze information about other teams in the league and how I can use that information to my advantage. 

The first addition I made to the app was a script that uses Python and Selenium to collect a "value" for each other team in the league and add it to a table in my database file. The script set to run automatically on the first of every month, and I use it to create a "Power Ranking" of all of the teams in the league.
